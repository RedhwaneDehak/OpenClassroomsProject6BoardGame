 * Each field on the map can be either empty or unavailable (obstacle).
 * On the map, a limited number of weapons (up to 4) will be placed randomly and can be collected by players who pass through.
 * You should invent at least 4 types of weapons in the game, each with different damage inflicted.
 * Each weapon has a name and associated visual.
 * The default weapon must inflict 10 points of damage.
 * The placement of the two players is also randomly on the map when the game loads (they should not touch).
 * For each turn, a player can move from 1 to 3 fields (horizontally or vertically) before ending their turn.
 * The players can not pass through obstacles.
 * If a player passes over a box containing a weapon, they leave their current weapon on site and replace it with the new one.
 * If players cross over adjacent squares (horizontally or vertically), a battle begins.
 * Each player attacks in turn.
 * The damage depends on the player's weapon.
 * The player can choose to attack or defend against the next shot.
 * If the player chooses to defend themselves, they sustain 50% less damage than normal.
 * As soon as the life points of a player (initially 100) falls to 0, the game is over.
